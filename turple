🔍 Tuple vs List in Python – Know the Technical Difference!

As a Python enthusiast, understanding the difference between Tuples and Lists is crucial for writing optimized and clean code. Here's a quick technical comparison:

📌 1. Mutability

List: Mutable – Can be changed

Tuple: Immutable – Cannot be changed

📌 2. Syntax

List ➝ [1, 2, 3]

Tuple ➝ (1, 2, 3)

📌 3. Speed

Tuple is slightly faster due to immutability

List is slower but more flexible

📌 4. Methods

List: append(), remove(), sort(), etc.

Tuple: Only count() and index()

📌 5. Hashability

List: ❌ Not hashable, can’t be dict keys

Tuple: ✅ Hashable (if elements are immutable), can be used as keys

📌 6. Memory Usage

Tuple uses less memory compared to List

📌 Best Use Cases

✅ List: Dynamic data, need modifications

✅ Tuple: Fixed collections like coordinates, constant values
